# Lore or Loot

Welcome to Lore or Loot, the social story driven RPG Web App.
Beware, this Software is in early stages and under active development. 

## Project Vision

This should be a "game" for people who love to read stories and be part of the story. Think of old D&D interactive books
for the digital age. It is also a platform for writers and lovers of fictional content. The project aims to provide authors a framework and ruleset to develop awesome 
adventures in a fictional world. For players it will be an open platform. 

The game will use agile methods to be developed and it uses modern software development methods (like PRs) to integrate
new content for the game.

## Tech Stack:

The frontend is coded using Astro and its island architecture. It allows a static generated website to be build. 
New content is developed using Markdown flavors (tbd.)

### Todos

- [ ] Backend to use
- [ ] Framework Base
- [ ] Fictional Base (Sci Fi, Fantasy, Mix, different flavors)

#### 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

### 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
